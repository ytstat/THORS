Description: We propose an effective THresholding method based on ORder Statistic, 
called THORS, to convert an arbitrary scoring-type classifier, which can induce a continuous 
cumulativedistribution function of the score, into a cost-sensitive one. The procedure uses 
the order statistic to find anoptimal threshold for classification, requiring almost no 
knowledge of the classifier itself. Unlike commondata-driven methods, we analytically show 
that THORS has theoretical guaranteed performance, theoreticalbounds for the costs and the 
lower time complexity.
